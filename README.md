# csv-migration
Simple command line tool that migrate one csv schema to another.

## About
This tool first objective is to help me clean data that was extracted from the different banking applications I am using. The idea is to unify the different schemas so that I can import them in a Google Sheet file.

## Features
You specify a source CSV file with a set of rules and the utility should produce the expected target CSV file.

## Prerequisites
```bash
> sudo apt update
> sudo apt install python3-pip
> pip install parse
```

## Usage

Export the history of the transactions from the Bank platform. In the downloaded CSV file, remove the first lines of metadata (keep the header line).
 Feet it to the script.

```bash
> ./migration.py -f <input file location> -d <output file location> -t <bank | sodexo>
```

## Stuff I should pay attention to
- Input file validation ðŸ›¡
    - Schema validation. Has the file the expected columns? Do we want the input file to strictly contain the expected columns? What if a column does not exist? 
    - Data validation: has the data the expected format or data type? Is a value optional?
    - Validation error handling: log it? ignore it? abort? fix it?

- Mapping
    - Map a column to another
    - Ignore columns?
    - Create new columns with computed value

- Filtering
    - Exclude rows with some values
    - Exclude rows with values outside of a range 

- Formatting
    - Should the column data be reformatted?
    - Is data correctly formatted?

- Implementation
    - Command line interface
    - JavaScript, TypeScript, Python?
    - Libraries?
